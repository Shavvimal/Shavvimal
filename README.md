<h2 align="center"> Welcome! </h2>

👋 Hey there! I'm **[Shav](https://shav.dev/)** - a Full-Stack Data Scientist, AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialist, and an aspiring entrepreneur. I specialize in crafting solutions in MLOps & software architecture, having been focused on scalable data streaming stacks optimized for low-latency, deploying DL architectures, and provisioning distributed Python servers for computation & model serving. I've applied my expertise in AWS, statistics, and database management to develop Risk Models and back-test/tune trading strategies at a crypto hedge fund 📈. Along the way, an in-house OMS platform led to the creation of <a href="https://www.quadra.trade/" rel="noreferrer">Quadra</a>, a Multi-Asset Multi-Exchange Crypto Portfolio Management & Execution system, which I spent over a year helping build and shape from the ground up.

### Chasing Dreams

In December, I took a leap of faith and I left my career to chase ✨ Entrepreneurship ✨. The dream of building something transformative from the ground up is what drives me. Currently, I'm channeling my energy into new projects, hackathons and constantly seeking opportunities to innovate and make a lasting impact.
