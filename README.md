<h2 align="center"> Welcome to my Profile!  </h2>

<p align="center">  Hi, I'm <a href="https://shav.dev/">Shav</a>! I'm a Full-Stack Data Scientist and aspiring entrepreneur. My tech journey has earned me credentials as an AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialist; I specialize in crafting solutions in MLOps & software architecture, having been focused on scalable data streaming stacks optimized for low-latency, deploying DL architectures, and provisioning distributed Python servers for computation & model serving. I've applied my expertise in AWS, statistics, and database management to develop Risk Models and back-test/tune trading strategies at a crypto hedge fund. Along the way, an in-house OMS platform led to the creation of Quadra, a Multi-Asset Multi-Exchange Crypto Portfolio Management & Execution system, which I spent over a year helping build and shape from the ground up.

But my true calling? Entrepreneurship. In December, I left my career to chase this dream. The dream of building something transformative from the ground up for myself is what drives me. Currently, I'm channeling my energy into new projects, hackathons and eagerly seeking opportunities to innovate and make a meaningful impact. Let's connect and explore how we can create something remarkable together.
