<h2 align="center"> Welcome! </h2>

Hey 👋, I'm Shav - Founder & CTO @ SAMMY (YC W25). I began my career as a Quant Developer at an Algorithmic and Quantitative Crypto Hedge Fund, optimizing trading strategies and engineering advanced risk models. I then served as the Founding Engineer at a Multi-Asset, Multi-Exchange Crypto Portfolio Management & Execution platform, building a robust, production-grade system from 0 ➡️ 1. Today, I'm channeling that same energy into SAMMY, automating onboarding, support & training with AI that mimics your users. I'm passionate about building relationships, so reach out and let's make waves together! 🌊
