<h2 align="center"> Welcome! </h2>

Hey 👋, I'm Shav - Technical Founder, Full-Stack Data Scientist, AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialist, and passionate entrepreneur. I started off as a Quant Dev at an algorithmic and quantitative crypto hedge fund, optimizing trading strategies and developing advanced risk models.

When the fund spun out [Quadra](https://www.quadra.trade/), a Multi-Asset, Multi-Exchange Crypto Portfolio Management & Execution platform, I became the founding engineer crafting production-ready scalable AI solutions and full-stack software architectures. I've expertise in low-latency data streaming stacks, deep learning deployment, distributed server provisioning for computation and model serving, and a touch of ✨ front end ✨.

Now I'm CTO full-time at a stealth startup building in the Agentic AI space 🥷. I'm all about forging relationships, so reach out!
