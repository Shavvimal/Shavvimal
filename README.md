👋 Hey there! I'm **[Shav](https://shav.dev/)** - a seasoned Technical Founder, Full-Stack Data Scientist, AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialist, and passionate entrepreneur. I specialize in crafting production-ready scalable AI solutions and software architectures, with expertise in low-latency data streaming stacks, deep learning deployment, and distributed server provisioning for computation and model serving.

My journey started at an algorithmic and quantitative crypto hedge fund, where I applied my skills in machine learning, cloud architecture, and statistics to develop advanced risk models and optimize trading strategies. I was also a founding engineer at **[Quadra](https://www.quadra.trade/)**, a Multi-Asset, Multi-Exchange Crypto Portfolio Management & Execution platform, which I helped build from the ground up.

🎙️ In my spare time, I co-host **[Dcypher AI](https://www.youtube.com/@dcypher-ai)**, a podcast where I explore cutting-edge AI topics with industry experts. I also maintain a **[blog](https://shav.dev/blog)** that documents my AI and tech journey, including novel methodologies for assessing cultural bias in large language models. Right now, im working in stealth on an agentic AI Startup
